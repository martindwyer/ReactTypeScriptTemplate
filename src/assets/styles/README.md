## Style Guide

#### Notes and Resources

All styling is compiled from Dart Sass.

The base styles come from Bootstrap 5.2 and are imported in \_custom.scss

The color pallette used for this project is stored in pallette.png

The image used to generate this pallette is in react.png.

The resource used to generate the pallette is at: http://colormind.io/image/

Color pallette variables are set in \_custom.scss

Styling for individual components can be found by component name in the /components folder. While these have been compiled into one index.css file, they could be separated with their component for reuse of code.
